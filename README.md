# BSPDR

BSPDR is a compiler for The SPDR Project. The language it compiles is similar to [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)), which is basically C with only one type, the unsigned integer.
The compiler outputs spdr assembly which can be compiled with SPAS. Note that the generated assembly is highly unoptimized.
